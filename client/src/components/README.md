This folder is where all the app's UI components go.
_Best practices_

- We are using MUI: https://mui.com/
- Do **not** write more than 50-60 lines of code in 1 component file. Break them down into seperate component files
- file names should start with an uppercase i.e. Button.js, etc.
- the key is to simplify your component to reuse other generic components
