TLDR; when you are making functions that make requests to our backend api, put the functions here.

The api folder usually contains functions, hooks, or utilities related to:

API Calls: Functions that handle making requests to external APIs (like a REST API or GraphQL endpoint).

API Configuration: Setting up instances of Axios or another HTTP client with predefined configurations.

Data Transformation: Functions that transform data from the shape returned by the API to the shape your application needs, or vice versa.

Examples of what you might find in an api folder:

Setup for Axios or another HTTP client.
CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for various resources.
Functions or hooks for fetching data.
